# Doctor_Map
The application will present the available doctors on a map, using map markers.

A JSON file is provided that contains an array of 10 doctor objects
with each object having a set of key/value pairs. Each doctor object contains general
information about the doctor and his/her location. The main objective of the assignment is to
consume this JSON file in order to create the requested map.

The application has been developed, using plain JavaScript and AJAX requests. 
JSON file (including doctors' information) is being consumed, and each Doctor is shown on the map.
